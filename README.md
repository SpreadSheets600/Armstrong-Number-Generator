# Armstrong Number Finder

This Python application identifies Armstrong numbers within a specified range using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## What are Armstrong Numbers?

An Armstrong number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the code using `python Generator.py`.

4. Click the "Find" button.

The application will display all Armstrong numbers within the specified range in the output box.
